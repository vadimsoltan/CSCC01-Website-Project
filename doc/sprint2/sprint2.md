## June 22 Meeting online 5:21 PM – 5:40 PM
(everyone)
  - We talked about the Contact Us form and what it should include if someone wanted to tell us something. We decided to opt in for a more general and simple contact form, rather then specialized ones (like having issues with a seller, or another user harassing, etc.). So far the user provides their information and simply fills in a message. This meeting talked about the following user story:
    - As a user, I want a Contact US form to contact the administrator so that he can receive my advice.

The meeting then went on with us discussing how we could help each other learn more from each other's expertise. The front end of the following user story was discussed during this meeting:
    - As a user, I want a Contact US form to contact the administrator so that he can receive my advice.

## June 26 Meeting on Campus from 6 PM – 7 PM (rough period)
(everyone)
  - Issues came up with showing user information in the front end. We discussed how the user should have to first fill information that wasn't required for registering such as, their location, their phone number, or their preferences. We decided to show the information after the user logged in, telling them to update it if they wanted personal information to be associated with their account. Following user stories were referenced:
    - As Allen Gestalt, a seller, I want to have a personal profile page to share some information such as email and personal interest, so that others can contact me in person and know more about me.
    - As Allen Gestalt, a seller, I want to add, view, edit and delete my account information so that I can updated it with my real life changes  and keep buyers updated.
    - As Alan Yang, a buyer, I want to add, view, edit and delete my account information so that I can updated it with my real life changes so other users can contact me.

## June 28 Meeting online from 11:20 AM – 11:31 AM

We decided on a design for the front end and how it would be implemented with the backend. The following user story was referenced in this meeting:
    - As Alan Yang, a buyer, I want to sort what I search based on some factors, so that I can easily compare items to make a choice. |4|3|
