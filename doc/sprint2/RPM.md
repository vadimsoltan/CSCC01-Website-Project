## Release Plan Meeting
- We discussed the front end design of our webpage in detail. We decided on a single page application for our web store. With users being able to login, signup, update their information, view posts and contact us (so far) from one easily accessible place. Namely the final UI for these following user stories has been discussed:
  - As Allen Gestalt, a seller, I want to have a personal profile page to share some information such as email and personal interest, so that others can contact me in person and know more about me.
  - As Alan Yang, a buyer, I want to have an account so that I can login to use functions such as comment and bookmark.
  - As Allen Gestalt, a seller, I want to add, view, edit and delete my account information so that I can updated it with my real life changes  and keep buyers updated.
  - As Alan Yang, a buyer, I want to add, view, edit and delete my account information so that I can updated it with my real life changes so other users can contact me.
  - As Alan Yang, a buyer, I want to search the books by inputting some keywords or labels, so that I can find what I need(buy or sell) easily. |2|4|
  
- Furthermore the backend implementation for a contact us form would be implemented and the front end would be added to the webpage, referencing this user story:
  - As a user, I want a Contact US form to contact the administrator so that he can receive my advice.
