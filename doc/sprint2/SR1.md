## Sprint 1 Retrospective meeting Wednesday, June 21 4:45 - 5:57 PM
  - During our sprint 1 retrospective meeting we were able to make great progress in
    respect to team communication as well as planning. We identified that we had
    an issue with distributing the workload among everyone on the team. We decided to
    identify current strengths that each team member showed during sprints 0 and 1, in other words what worked well for us so far,
    and move on from there. Haitao Zhu, Xinyi Hou, Minqi Wang having more experience
    with the technology we are using for the project kept working on the back end for
    the web store, meanwhile Jingying Li and Vadim Soltan focused on the front end as
    well as team documentation. Furthermore we decided that everyone would contribute to each other's area of work on this project
    so that we would further learn from one another. In other words front end team members would contribute to the backend, and vice versa.
