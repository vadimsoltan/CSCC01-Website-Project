## July 13 Meeting online from 10 AM – 10:45 AM

- We all talked about the front-end design to get a better pictured about how we should approach the general idea of the project. We settled on the fact that since it will be a user run webstore, we should start off with the users. 
Specifically, the meeting was related to the following feature/user-story:

So, we created a login and register form for the user on the front end.
