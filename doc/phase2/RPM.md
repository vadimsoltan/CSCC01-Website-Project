### Release Plan Meeting:
(everyone)

For this sprint’s release, during our meeting, all participants decided to focus on basic UI for users to login/register, however mainly we put more effort into the database and backend of the web store focusing on the model and control part of our MVC driven approach of development. More specifically we focused on the backend for posts of books for sale, users such as buyers and sellers, or administrators, as well as messaging or commenting for a post.

Specifically, here are the user stories linked to these features:
- As Alan Yang, a buyer, I want to have an account so that I can login to use functions such as comment and bookmark. 
- As Alan Yang, a buyer, I want to have an account so that I can login to use functions such as comment and bookmark.
- As Alan Yang, a buyer, I want to comment under the posts so that I can communicate with sellers to check some details
- As Danny Chen, a seller, I want to create a post for the second-hand textbooks I want to sell at school, so that I don’t need to take these books home.
- As Danny Chen, a seller, I want to have a communication system to contact buyers, other sellers and administrators, so that I don’t need to share my personal contact information.
- As Allen Gestalt, a seller, I want to have a personal profile page to share some information such as email and personal interest, so that others can contact me in person and know more about me.

These features for now do not have a fully functioning front-end implementation, however they will of course. We felt that figuring out the backend and database of the web store would be more important, and only created enough of a front end for this sprint to have a general guide for which direction we would like to go and test our backend.
