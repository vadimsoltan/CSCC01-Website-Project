### First Meeting
- First and foremost we all decided to provide ideas for the project in an online chat room. All our meetings took place online as it was most convenient for all team members. We debated on creating an Android App or a Online Webstore, we argued about the complexity of each option and, once we finally set our minds on one clear idea with which everyone was mostly comfortable we moved onto deciding how to separate the work load.

### Second Meeting
- During our second meeting the team decided to split the workload as follows. One group member would keep track of the discourse during the meetings and record them, afterwards they would compress the information into process.md, they would also make sure to describe the project in the summary.md and further explain it in competition.md. 2 group members would focus on user stories and the others would also contribute if possible into a google doc created and shared among the team mates. Another group member would create the Personas.pdf file required and create the layout for the project. The last group member would contribute to PB.md and define done.md.

### Third Meeting
- During our third meeting we discussed the user stories which have been created so far and how we can make more. This lead into a discussion on whether we need to make more, since user stories are essentially features of the webstore that we would have to implement in the future. We decided to create as many as rationally possible and practical and sort them based on importance as it appeared to us. This would allow us to have a specific order in which to implement them.

### Fourth Meeting
- During our fourth meeting we discussed the layout of our webstore and how we should approach its design. We decided to go with something more intuitive and practical, and admittedly also quite common. Decisions like this one took place a lot and they were not guided by votes, rather a unanimous decision by everyone present.

### Fifth Meeting
- During our fifth meeting we discussed what it would mean for our project to be done and how we would know if it were done. At first our goals were optimistic however we decided to lower our expectations and over deliver, rather than have high expectations of and under deliver. We have a "core set of features", and additionally some much desired features, ("additional features") which would improve the web store. We decided that when we would finish the "additional features" we would consider the web store done. However, we only mean done in the sense that it would be functional and intuitive to use. We also have other features which would be beneficial to a seller or a buyer but that are not as high on our list.

### Notes:
- These meetings did not take place with equal gaps of time in between, they were somewhat spontaneous.
- Looking forward to the next phases we will look to make the meetings more structured and organized so that we can have a more efficiently spent time during these group meetings.
