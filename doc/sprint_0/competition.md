### What is the competition and how is it the same?
- Our competition will of course be amazon.com and ebay.com as well as kijiji.ca. eBay and kijiji are very similar to our webstore because they are less centralized than Amazon and more user driven. In other words the users have the ultimate say in what is on the market and how it will be sold and delivered, meanwhile Amazon provides services like Prime and Full-filled by Amazon where they produce their own products and also store sellers products in warehouses to be sold and delivered at a later date.

### How is it worse then others?
- All three of the mentioned web stores are major service providers. Meaning they provide a lot of support around their services as well as a large user base input on the products they sell. In other words they can offer better costumer service as well as more reviews on products. 

### How is it different?
- Our webstore will target one specfic group. We believe due to the granularity of our concept we would be able to attract enough of a userbase so that the web store can sustain itself.
