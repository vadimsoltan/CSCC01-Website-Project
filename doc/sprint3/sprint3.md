## July 11 Meeting online from 12:05 PM – 12:21 PM
(everyone)
- We talked about how buyers and sellers should be able to communicate with one another over the webstore. Since the model for our webstore is more closely related to kijiji then something like amazon we decided to make it so that if a buyer wanted to purchase something they would have to communicate with the seller about price negotiation and method of exchange. We realize that this would not scale however because if a seller would be selling something in larger ammounts they would have a hard time managing that kind of communication with the sellers. This however would keep users from gaining monopoly on a set of items and promote individuals to sell more competitively. The following user stories were involved:
  -  As Alan Yang, a buyer, I want to comment under the posts so that I can communicate with sellers to check some details.
  - As Danny Chen, a seller, I want to have a communication system to contact buyers, other sellers and administrators, so that I don’t need to share my personal contact information.
