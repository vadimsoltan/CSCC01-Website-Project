## Release Plan Meeting
- For this sprint we focused on posts, in particular both on the front end and the back end of the posts feature for the webstore. Users would able to see created posts, with the date of creation, title of the post, the user who created the post and the price. Furthermore the users would be able to search for the post they are interested in the list and contact the seller of that particular post. The following user stories are to be referenced for this sprint:
- As Danny Chen, a seller, I want to create a post for the second-hand textbooks I want to sell at school, so that I don’t need to take these books home.
- As Danny Chen, a seller, I want to have a communication system to contact buyers, other sellers and administrators, so that I don’t need to share my personal contact information.
-  As Penny Mckee, a seller, I want to add, view, edit and delete my posts from history so that I can make more money by selling books more efficiently.
- As Alan Yang, a buyer, I want to search the books by inputting some keywords or labels, so that I can find what I need(buy or sell) easily.
- As Alan Yang, a buyer, I should be able to bookmark posts so that I can view them whenever I want.
-  As Alan Yang, a buyer, I want to comment under the posts so that I can communicate with sellers to check some details.
- As Alan Yang, a buyer, I want to report some posts or comments for violating the agreement and regulation, so that administer can give disciplines under his power.
