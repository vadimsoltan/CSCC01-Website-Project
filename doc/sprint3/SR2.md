## Sprint 2 Retrospective meeting Wednesday, July 5 4:45 - 5:55 PM
  - During our sprint 2 retrospective meeting we were able to delegate the tasks among the team members much more efficiently. Since we have been working together almost the entire semester and we had developed a system which worked efficiently for us so far therefore we decided to stick with it. In other words, as mentioned before Haitao Zhu, Xinyi Hou, Minqi Wang having more experience with the technology we are using for the project kept working on the back end for the web store, meanwhile Jingying Li and Vadim Soltan focused on the front end as well as team documentation. For sprint 3 we would keep developing new features based on the ones we had implemented so far, so we discussed which ones we could reuse and how we should move forward from there through our user stories.
